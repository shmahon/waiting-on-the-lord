        "Micah 1:12 - 'The inhabitant of Maroth waited anxiously (ḥûl) for good'"
      ],
      "contrast_with_other_words": "While qāwāh is tense, yāḥal is yearning, and dāmam is silent, ḥûl is writhing—the most viscerally intense waiting word.",

      "note": "Some lexicons distinguish ḥûl I ('writhe') from ḥûl II ('hope/wait'), but they likely share semantic roots—both involve intense internal motion."

  "thematic_overview": "Hebrew vocabulary for 'waiting on God' is rich and varied. From silent trust (dāmam) to anxious travail (ḥûl), from patient tarrying (ḥākāh) to yearning hope (yāḥal), and especially the active, expectant tension (qāwāh), these words paint a full picture of what it means to depend on God through time. Waiting is not monolithic—it has many faces and emotional registers, all honored in Scripture."

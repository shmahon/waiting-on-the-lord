# Stage 3: Educational Content Creation - Complete

## Overview
Stage 3 has created comprehensive educational content to support the document generation. This includes detailed explanations of Hebrew and Greek grammatical concepts, full lexical definitions, and integration strategies.

## Files Created

### 1. Hebrew Stem System (`data/hebrew_stems.json`)
**Complete explanation of all seven Hebrew verb stems (binyanim)**

Covered stems:
- **Qal** - Simple active (most common)
- **Niphal** - Simple passive/reflexive
- **Piel** - Intensive active
- **Pual** - Intensive passive
- **Hiphil** - Causative active
- **Hophal** - Causative passive
- **Hithpael** - Reflexive/reciprocal intensive

Each stem includes:
- Category and meaning
- Detailed description
- Characteristics
- Example with waiting vocabulary
- Theological significance
- Why it matters for our study

**Key insight**: The stem system is critical for understanding nuance. Qal = simple waiting, Piel = intense hoping, Hiphil = causing to wait. Each adds theological depth.

### 2. Hebrew Grammatical Concepts (`data/hebrew_concepts.json`)
**Learners' notes for 8 Hebrew grammatical concepts**

Concepts explained:
1. **Perfect** - Completed action
2. **Imperfect** - Incomplete/ongoing action
3. **Sequential Perfect** - Narrative continuation (waw-consecutive)
4. **Sequential Imperfect** - Narrative progression (waw-consecutive)
5. **Participle** - Verbal adjective (ongoing/characteristic action)
6. **Imperative** - Command form

Special section on Greek voice system explaining middle voice and deponents.

**Key insight**: Many Greek "waiting" verbs are deponents—this fits theologically because waiting on God involves personal investment (middle voice nuance) but active participation.
